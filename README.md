# Woodblock Example Project

This is an example Unity project for my Unity package Woodblock, a basic game manager and UI for games written in INK.

Please see the main package repo at https://github.com/rSherriff/woodblock for documentation about Woodblock.

This example project shows off the existing features of Woodblock in its most simple manner. Inspect the .ink file to see how images and audio is triggered from ink, and the WoodblockData file to see how the rendering of the game is declared.

This project depends on the Woodblock package and the Ink Unity integration, both will be pulled when you load the project.
